# Image segmentation Using K-Means

Image segmentation is the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple image segments, also known as image regions or image objects. There are various types of image segmentation techniques but our focus will be on colour-based segmentation. We generally do image segmentation to reduce the complexity of the image and allow the image to be used in various tasks, such as Object Detection later on.

The code performs colour-based segmentation using a K-Means algorithm and compares 2 outputs. The value of K represents the number of colours we categorize the pixels into. One output is from using the algorithm with K=3 and the other is from using k=8. You can see the comparison of the results at the end of the code file (KMeansSeg.ipynb).
